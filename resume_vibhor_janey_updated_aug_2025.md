## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Bristol Myers Squibb**  
**Senior Manager, AI Solution Architect, GPS BI&T**  
*Jul 2025 – present | New Brunswick, NJ*

- Architecting an **agentic orchestration layer** with a **graph-based workflow engine**; **containerized** for elastic deployment; leveraging **data lake query engines** over **object storage**; roadmap includes **enterprise QMS** API integration.
- Implementing **MCP tool declarations** to standardize capability exposure across agents and systems; designing guardrails, RBAC, and audit trails aligned to GxP expectations.
- Building pipelines to **identify, document, and perform RCA** on deviations; auto-generating **CAPA** drafts (HITL); constructing **semantic knowledge bases** from historical deviation worklists and SOPs (decision-tree → **Mermaid** capture for LLM context) and enabling **text-to-SQL** access to past deviations.
- Delivering an **AI copilot & decision-support** experience targeting **5,000+** manufacturing and quality users; instrumenting telemetry for quality of advice, latency, and adoption.
- Authoring validation approach and controls for AI components (requirements traceability, risk-based testing, model monitoring); implementing an **LLM observability and tracing layer** for generation traceability, prompt versioning, and end-to-end visibility testing to support validation.

**Manager, Data Architecture, Global Product Development & Supply**  
*Jul 2023 – Jul 2025 | New Brunswick, NJ*

- Led information & data architecture for manufacturing, including a **Batch Genealogy** graph data product unifying **SAP, Oracle EBS, and CMO** sources; reduced data processing time by >40%.
- Architected and integrated **CMO genealogy (DDE)** from **CoA/CoC** documents into the **Batch Genealogy Data Product (BGDP)**, enabling traceability and compliance.
- Integrated **BGDP** with **SAP Batch Release Hub** under the **APMC** program (Component Check), automating batch release decisions; improved release decision efficiency by >50%.
- Developed **BGDP API/extract features** to support enterprise integration and analytics use cases.
- Launched a **metadata cataloging** initiative for the manufacturing data lake, aligning business and technical metadata across 7+ source integrations.

**Formulatrix**  
**Machine Learning Intern**  
*Jun 2022 – Aug 2022 | Bedford, MA*

- Built a computer vision model to classify microplates for the FAST Liquid Handler; achieved 98.59% accuracy across datasets.
- Implemented in TensorFlow using **Classification-by-Retrieval (CbR)**; tested on Raspberry Pi Zero & Coral Edge TPU.
- Created an API configuration for image capture and curated labeled datasets under varied conditions.
- Conducted a salary analysis across multiple offices; built a regression model in R to forecast increments and visualized results.

**Zebra Technologies**  
**Software Engineer**  
*Oct 2019 – Jun 2021 | Kennesaw, GA*

- Led the front-end design team for a new product launch; redesigned UX in Figma/Adobe XD and implemented with React.
- Collaborated to deploy an anomaly detection model in Python combining a boxplot method with FBProphet.
- Contributed to the inception and design of a new banking branch management product.
